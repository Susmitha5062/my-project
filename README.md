# Project 7: News-Grid-Website

[Click here](https://sharp-villani-89155f.netlify.app/) for the live demo  of the website on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

> This is a website for a media firm to keep its customers updated with the current affairs in the field of sports, entertainment, technology, fashion, etc, with a working subscription form to update with newsletter through email. The firm can publish the articles written by its members. 

- The website also has a working form to collect the data of the customers for newsletter subscriptions.

- All the outer layouts and most of the inner layouts (like navbar) are done using `CSS grid`.

- An `image overlay` is created for the hero image using `::before and ::after pseudo-selectors`.

- Icons are used from `Font Awesome`.

- `Flexbox` is used for creating some inner layouts.

- A separate article page is created.

- The side widgets are responsive. Each new article to the side will be stacked one above the other.

- A newsletter subscription form is created using `Netlify Forms` for email data collection.

- A `favicon` is added with a .ico format.

- The website is made `responsive` to all the devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).

- CSS is precompiled using `SCSS` for the structured coding.

- The website is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

- The project is a part of the learning from [Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy)'s course on Udemy. The idea credit is his. I have understood the concepts and learned them by building this on my own with a bare minimum reference of source code (only when my efforts couldn't clear the roadblock). The way of execution is modified as per my viewpoint whenever is necessary.
